* Create a KV store with inMemoryValues:false
* Plug a serializer/unserializer to values, for storing any documents (use “JSBinDat” module)
* Direct access with the key, which is the ID, is already provided
* ID must be immutable
* For big DB, plug the “megahash” module as a replacement for ES6 Map()
* Creating an index is creating another KV store:
	* the key is the index serialized to a string
	* the value is a serialized array of document ID
* When the document is modified, all the indexed should be computed, old indexes must be deleted, new should be created
